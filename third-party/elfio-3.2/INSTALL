ELFIO is a header-only C++ library - installation does not require any
(pre)compilation step. Just copy 'elfio' folder into standard include directory.

For example:
    cp -R elfio /usr/include
    
Alternatively, it is possible to modify compiler's include search path -
'-I<dir>' option in GCC; '/I<dir>' in MSVC.

Makefile(s) that come with the distribution package are provided for
example files compilation only.

To compile the examples, use the commands below:
    ./configure
    make
